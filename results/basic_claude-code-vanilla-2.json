      "msg": "response: The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices, varies. For example, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom all have an average invoice total of approximately $5.37. Austria has an average of about $6.09, Brazil's average is around $5.43, and Canada's is approximately $5.43. Chile has a higher average of about $6.66, while the Czech Republic's average is around $6.45. Finland's average is approximately $5.95, France's is around $5.57, and Germany's is about $5.59. Hungary and Ireland both have an average of approximately $6.52. India's average is around $5.79, the Netherlands' is about $5.80, and Norway's is approximately $5.66. Portugal and Sweden both have an average of around $5.52. The USA has an average invoice total of approximately $5.75.\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response provides exactly this information and much more. It starts by stating \"The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices, varies\" which directly addresses the expected requirement. Then it goes on to provide specific average invoice totals for numerous countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK at ~$5.37; Austria at ~$6.09; Brazil at ~$5.43; Canada at ~$5.43; Chile at ~$6.66; Czech Republic at ~$6.45; Finland at ~$5.95; France at ~$5.57; Germany at ~$5.59; Hungary and Ireland at ~$6.52; India at ~$5.79; Netherlands at ~$5.80; Norway at ~$5.66; Portugal and Sweden at ~$5.52; USA at ~$5.75). The Test response fully covers what was expected (the average invoice totals per country with the specified filter) and provides comprehensive detailed data. The additional specific values and country-by-country breakdown enhance rather than contradict the expected response."
