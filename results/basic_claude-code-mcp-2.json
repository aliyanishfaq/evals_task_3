The Czech Republic, which has the highest number of invoices (14) among the shown countries, averages $6.45 per invoice. Austria rounds out the top 5 with an average of $6.09.\n\nAt the lower end of the range, several countries including Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Australia, and Argentina all show an average invoice total of $5.37.\n\nThe data shows relatively small variations in average invoice totals across countries, ranging from $5.37 to $6.66, with most countries having 7 invoices each, except for the Czech Republic with 14 invoices.\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response fully covers this requirement by:\n\n1. Explicitly stating it shows \"average invoice totals by country (only including countries with 5 or more invoices)\" - this directly matches the filtering criteria in the Expected response\n2. Providing specific average invoice totals for multiple countries (Chile $6.66, Ireland and Hungary $6.52, Czech Republic $6.45, Austria $6.09, and several countries at $5.37)\n3. Including additional context about invoice counts (Czech Republic with 14 invoices, most others with 7) which supports the filtering criteria\n\nWhile the Test response includes much more detail than the Expected response (specific country names, exact averages, rankings, and analysis), it contains all the core information requested: average invoice totals by country with the specified filtering condition. The extra details and analysis don't contradict the expected information - they enhance it. The Test response successfully answers what was asked for in the Expected response."
