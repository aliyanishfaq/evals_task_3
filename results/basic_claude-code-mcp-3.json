Here's the average invoice total for each country that has at least 5 invoices:\n\n- **Argentina**: The average invoice total is approximately $5.37.\n- **Australia**: The average invoice total is about $5.37.\n- **Austria**: The average invoice total is around $6.09.\n- **Belgium**: The average invoice total is approximately $5.37.\n- **Brazil**: The average invoice total is about $5.43.\n- **Canada**: The average invoice total is around $5.43.\n- **Chile**: The average invoice total is approximately $6.66.\n- **Czech Republic**: The average invoice total is about $6.45.\n- **Denmark**: The average invoice total is around $5.37.\n- **Finland**: The average invoice total is approximately $5.95.\n\nThese averages are calculated for countries with at least 5 invoices. If you need more details or information about other countries, feel free to ask!\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response provides exactly this information by listing multiple countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland) with their respective average invoice totals, and explicitly states that \"These averages are calculated for countries with at least 5 invoices.\" This directly satisfies the requirement of excluding countries with less than 5 invoices. The Test response contains all the information requested in the Expected response, plus additional helpful details like specific numerical values and formatting. The core requirement is fully met."
