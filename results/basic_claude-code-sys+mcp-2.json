Explicitly stating it's analyzing \"average invoice totals by country, considering only countries with 5 or more invoices\" - which directly matches the exclusion criteria\n2. Providing specific average invoice totals for multiple countries (Chile $6.66, Ireland and Hungary $6.52, Czech Republic $6.45, USA $5.75, Canada $5.43, France $5.57, and several countries at $5.37)\n3. Including additional context like the number of invoices per country and the range of averages ($5.37 to $6.66)\n4. Confirming that 24 countries met the criteria of having 5 or more invoices\n\nThe Test response contains all the core information requested in the Expected response (average invoice totals by country, excluding those with fewer than 5 invoices) plus additional valuable details. There are no contradictions or missing elements from what was expected."
