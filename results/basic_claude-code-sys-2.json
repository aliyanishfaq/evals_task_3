The Czech Republic, while having more invoices (14), comes in fourth with an average of $6.45 per invoice.\n\nThe USA has the highest number of invoices (91) among all countries, with an average invoice total of $5.75. Other notable countries include India with 13 invoices averaging $5.79, and several European countries like Austria ($6.09), Finland ($5.95), and the Netherlands ($5.80).\n\nMost countries in the analysis appear to have average invoice totals ranging between $5.50 and $6.70, showing relatively consistent pricing across different markets.\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"The average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response fully covers this requirement by:\n\n1. Explicitly stating that the analysis includes \"24 countries that have 5 or more invoices\" - this directly addresses the exclusion criteria\n2. Providing specific average invoice totals for multiple countries (Chile $6.66, Ireland $6.52, Hungary $6.52, Czech Republic $6.45, USA $5.75, India $5.79, Austria $6.09, Finland $5.95, Netherlands $5.80)\n3. Giving a general range for most countries ($5.50 to $6.70)\n\nThe Test response goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing additional context like the number of invoices per country and comparative analysis, but it contains all the core information requested in the Expected response. The filtering criterion (excluding countries with less than 5 invoices) is clearly acknowledged and applied, and average invoice totals per country are provided throughout the response."
