The Czech Republic has an average of $6.45 across 14 invoices, while the USA, with the most invoices (91), averages $5.75 per invoice. The data includes averages for 24 countries in total.\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"the average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response fully covers this requirement by:\n\n1. Explicitly stating the filtering criteria: \"Among countries with 5 or more invoices\" - this directly matches the exclusion of countries with less than 5 invoices\n2. Providing specific average invoice totals for multiple countries that meet this criteria (Chile at $6.66, Ireland and Hungary at $6.52, Czech Republic at $6.45, USA at $5.75)\n3. Including additional context about invoice counts (Czech Republic has 14 invoices, USA has 91 invoices) and total countries included (24 countries)\n\nThe Test response goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing specific examples and additional details, but it completely covers what was asked for in the Expected response. The core information requested - average invoice totals per country with the specified filtering - is fully present in the Test response."
