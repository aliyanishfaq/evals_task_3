      "msg": "response: Based on the data, I can provide an analysis of average invoice totals across different countries, considering only those with 5 or more invoices:\n\nThe USA has the highest number of invoices (91) with an average total of $5.75, followed by Canada (56 invoices, $5.43 average) and Brazil (35 invoices, $5.43 average).\n\nChile shows the highest average invoice total at $6.66, despite having only 7 invoices. Other countries with notably high averages include the Czech Republic ($6.45), Hungary ($6.52), and Ireland ($6.52).\n\nThe lowest average invoice totals of $5.37 are shared by several countries including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\n\nMost European countries maintain average invoice totals between $5.37 and $6.09, with 24 countries in total meeting the minimum threshold of 5 invoices.\nreasoning: The Expected response asks for \"the average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response fully covers this requirement by:\n\n1. Explicitly stating it considers \"only those with 5 or more invoices\" - directly addressing the exclusion criteria\n2. Providing specific average invoice totals for multiple countries (e.g., USA $5.75, Canada $5.43, Brazil $5.43, Chile $6.66, etc.)\n3. Giving comprehensive coverage across different countries and regions\n4. Confirming that 24 countries meet the minimum threshold of 5 invoices\n\nThe Test response goes beyond the basic requirement by providing additional context like invoice counts, comparative analysis, and regional patterns, but this extra information doesn't detract from meeting the core requirement. The response demonstrates that it has calculated and presented the average invoice totals per country while properly excluding countries with fewer than 5 invoices, which is exactly what the Expected response requested."
