      "msg": "response: Based on the query results, here's what we can observe:\n\n1. Chile has the highest average invoice total at $6.66, with 7 invoices\n2. Ireland and Hungary tie for second place with an average of $6.52 per invoice\n3. The USA has the most invoices (91) with an average of $5.75 per invoice\n4. The Czech Republic has the second-highest number of invoices (14) among the top results, with an average of $6.45\n\nThe results show that there's relatively modest variation in average invoice totals across countries, ranging from about $5.66 to $6.66 for the countries shown. It's worth noting that this analysis only includes countries with 5 or more invoices, which helps ensure we're looking at more representative averages rather than potentially outlier cases from countries with very few transactions.\nreasoning: The Test response fully covers the information in the Expected response. The Expected response asks for \"the average invoice total per country, excluding countries with less than 5 invoices.\" The Test response provides exactly this information by:\n\n1. Presenting specific average invoice totals for multiple countries (Chile: $6.66, Ireland and Hungary: $6.52, USA: $5.75, Czech Republic: $6.45)\n2. Explicitly stating at the end that \"this analysis only includes countries with 5 or more invoices\"\n3. Providing additional context about the range of averages ($5.66 to $6.66) and explaining why the 5+ invoice threshold was used\n\nWhile the Test response includes extra details like the number of invoices per country and additional analysis, it completely addresses the core requirement of showing average invoice totals per country while excluding countries with fewer than 5 invoices. The additional information enhances rather than contradicts the expected response."
